\title{torpor: torpor: Mixture model aimed at assigning metabolic rate measurements (M)
to torpor and euthermia in heterothermic endotherms.}
\description{
This package enables the assignment of M to torpor or euthermia. It uses the v
ariation in M measured during euthermic rest and torpor at different ambient
temperatures (Ta) to estimate the lower critical temperature (Tlc) of the
thermoneutral zone (TNZ) and determine physiological state membership
using mixture models. In addition, this package enables the further prediction
of M during rest and torpor along Ta, including resting metabolic rate within the TNZ.
}
\details{
This package is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics.
More information can be found on the companion article Fasel et al.
(Biol Open 15 April 2022; 11 (4): bio059064. doi: https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.059064)
and in the vignettes.

This package is center around the \code{\link[=tor_fit]{tor_fit()}} function which enables to fit
mixture models on metabolic rates data using Bayesian inference.
}
\section{tor_fit}{

The function \code{\link[=tor_fit]{tor_fit()}} considers the relation between metabolic rate (M)
and ambient temperature (Ta) assumed by the Scholander-Irving model and its
later extensions.

Resting M measured within the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) is independent of Ta.
This rate is hereafter referred to as Mtnz, although it would correspond to
the basal metabolic rate (BMR) provided that the specific criteria for the BMR
are met (see Fasel et al. in prep.). Below the lower critical temperature of
TNZ (Tlc), M of euthermic animals increases linearly with decreasing Ta.
M of torpid animals increases linearly with decreasing Ta to maintain a minimal
body temperature below some threshold ambient temperature (Tt). This state is
usually referred to as "regulated torpor". Between Tt and Tlc, M of torpid
animals follows an exponential curve. In this Ta range, torpor is referred to
as "conforming torpor".

\section{tor_plot}{

The function \code{\link[=tor_plot]{tor_plot()}} is a wrapper function around the [tor_fit())] and [tor_predict()].

It uses [tor_fit()] to fit a mixture model using#'Bayesian inference and plot
the predicted value as well as the raw data. Measures are presented in different
colors depending on the metabolic state. Predicted values as well as 95\% credible
interval (segmented lines) are also presented. This function enables the user
to replicate the analysis done in Fasel et al. (in prep).

[tor_predict()]: R:tor_predict()

}

\section{tor_predict}{


The function provides the predicted M and 95\% credible interval boundaries
at a defined Ta given a certain model, in euthermic and/or torpid state.
}

\section{tor_assign}{

The function assign the individual points according to their estimated state.
}

\section{tor_summarise}{

The function gives a summary statistic of the model fit.
