Description: This package enables the assignment of M to torpor, euthermia.
  It uses the variation in M measured during euthermic rest and torpor at different 
  ambient temperatures (Ta) to estimate the lower critical temperature (Tlc) of 
  the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) and determine physiological state membership using 
  mixture models. In addition, this package enables the further prediction of M 
  during euthermic rest and torpor along Ta, including resting metabolic rate 
  within the TNZ.
  This package is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics.

  and in the vignettes.
  This package is center around the tor_fit() function which enables to fit mixture
  models on metabolic rates data using Bayesian inference.
